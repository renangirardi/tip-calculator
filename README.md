Tip Calculator Project

We will create a JavaScript Tip Calculator. For this, there's no need for a user interface.

Here are the steps your code need to do:

- Ask the user how much cost the meal
- Ask how much is the restaurant tip percentage.
- Ask how much peeple the user is splitting the bill.
- Print to the user: The meal cost, the total cost with the tip, the user share (the amount splited between the number of people)
